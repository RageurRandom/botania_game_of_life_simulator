# Simulator of the game of life for Botania
Small project I made to learn C++.

## Features
Botania is a mod for Minecraft available [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania](here).
In this mod, you can get the "Dandelifeon" which generates more or less power by launching a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life](game of life) with specials rules.
This program can launch this game, so you can try patterns and see by yourself wich one is the most efficient.

## Installation
